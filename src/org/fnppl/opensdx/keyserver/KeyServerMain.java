 * I am a bit bored of twiggling around with annoying formats, frameworks and paddings and whatever
 * 
 * I think, it would be nice to have a good (which does not mean, those other solutions are not good), clean, clean-room-implementation of what suits ME best...
 * 
 * of yourse, now it makes sense to separate the http-parts from tsas AND keyserver into an own package... later...

/*
 * 1. registering a new publickey should always be possible (confirmation-email is sent and has to be accepted)
 * 2. adding an approval to any publickey should be possible - if that approving key is also registered
 * 3. it would be good to multiplex to/from gpgkeyser.de or such
 * 4. a strict separation between publickey and approval(chains) is desired
 * 5. different verification-levels should be available on each key/approval
 * 6. such things as "certificate" are much appreciated to be done better here. horrible: x509v3 - why on earth? 
 * 7. communication with this server is to be done via client-api (commandline) - although browser would also be possible - but i am not into giving ssl a try...
